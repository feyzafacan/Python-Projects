# Adventure Game
## PROJECT 4 (easy)

This is an example of a simple story game. The game branches by making the user make choices and progresses to a different adventure each time. We can improve this game by diversifying the questions and make it long-lasting. 
The project aims to understand the intertwined inputs in a general sense.
